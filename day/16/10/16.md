# Shell automation

I'm finally organizing/automating my shell now. There are a ton of things happened since I last spend time on this (maybe 2013 or 2014). So many tools that that help you speedup/decorate your terminal. You can go really deep if you want, and set up an environment with the thousands? of tools available. I believe if you're a tidy freak, you can make an environment that bootstraps easily, with managed state, and all config automated/version controlled.

Here's some of the things I did

- tidy up oh-my-zsh setup
- setup EC2 ssh environment that uses a long living tmux, as well as syncing a minimal resource file
- brew to install all packages, including system package and Apps.
- version control dotfiles

Here's my TODO:

- configure macOS itself with Apple commands
- cleanup all directories
- Version control most of the things
  - dotfiles
  - toy
  - all notes
  - all source code
